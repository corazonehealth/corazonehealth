      How stretching can improve your heart and increase your life
    </h5>
    <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
      Resting heart rate (HR) can be anywhere from 50 to 100 beats per minute (BPM).
      Whenever you exercise, your heart rate goes up, and sometimes you can feel your heart pump faster.
      You may feel warmer, and perhaps even sweat a little bit.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
      It is normal for blood pressure (BP) to rise with exercise, and with proper cool-downs,
      your blood pressure will return to baseline values. However, if the exercise is particularly challenging,
      like hiking a mountain, HR and BP may spike, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
      When muscles work extra hard, they demand more blood that your heart can no longer supply effectively.
      Simple tasks like reaching for the top shelf or walking up stairs may feel difficult.
      When forced to move in ways your body isnâ€™t accustomed to, HR and BP rise, creating stress for the heart.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
      Studies show that three key factors contribute to longevity: independence, heart health, and leg strength.
      If basic stretches or movements, like reaching your toes or climbing stairs, are difficult, you risk straining your heart.
      This could lead to cardiac events and a trip to the ER.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
      Even if walking, cycling, or standing for 10 minutes feels challenging,
      performing short stretches for your hips, shoulders, and ankles can prevent HR and BP from spiking.
      Over time, regular stretching will help improve your quality of life, regardless of your ability to perform intense physical activity.
